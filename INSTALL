To install traIXroute with all the necessary packages follow the instructions as they seem below.
The tool has been tested in Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04 and Mac OS X (>=10.9).

1) Run the following script to install all the necessary packages for the traIXroute. The installation script in the setup directory automate the whole installation process to properly run the tool:

	$ sudo bash ./setup/install.sh

	# ---------------
	# For Mac OS X:
	# ---------------
	# Ensure you have installed the Xcode command line developer tools before. To install run:

	$ xcode-select --install

2) After finishing the installation process, proceed with the documentation to run the tool with all the proper arguments.

3) You can add to the PATH enviroment variable the bin directory to run traixroute globally.

4) The first time you run traIXoute, a folder is created in the home directory (named "traixroute") containing all the dataset and configuration files.

5) Check your firewall in case you filter certain types of packets to avoid getting unresponsive traces. Otherwise, traIXroute will not run properly.

6) The 'config' file contains all the necessary URLs for traIXroute to download all the datasets. 
There you can also add your RIPE Atlas measurment key. By default, the "num_of_cores" tag is configured to value "-1". 
This means that traIXroute utilizes all the available cores of the local machine. 
Otherwise you can select the exact number of cores to make available for the tool.
